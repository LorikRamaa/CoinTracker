    "description": "Bitcoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market. First introduced in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has held the crypto markets number one spot according to market capitalization. Bitcoin paved the way for many existing altcoins in the market and marked a pivotal moment for digital payment solutions. <br /><br /> As the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has come a long way in terms of its value. However, one does not have to buy an entire bitcoin as bitcoins can be divided into small units called satoshis, named after the creator. A satoshi is equivalent to 0.00000001 bitcoin. <br /><br /> There is no physical BTC token so Bitcoin operates as a digital currency. Bitcoin transactions are fully transparent and can’t be censored, providing a global, censorship-resistant medium for financial exchange. It’s a financial system backed by decentralized network of computers, known as ‘nodes’, instead of centralized banking or governmental entity, thereby promoting ‘decentralization’."

    "description": "Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency token in terms of market capitalization. This can be attributed to how it has brought much innovation and many use cases to the industry by introducing smart contract functionality, which has paved the way for decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized apps (DApps). <br /><br /> Ethereum was created in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer. The platform is based on the principle of decentralization, which means that it is not controlled by any single entity. <br /><br /> Ethereum allows users to build and deploy software, commonly in the form of DApps, which are then powered by a global distributed network of computers running Ethereum. The network is decentralized, making it highly resistant to any form of censorship or downtime. <br /><br /> In addition, Ethereum is an open-source blockchain platform that runs on the usage of its native currency, called Ether or ETH. All network transaction fees, or gas fees, are paid in ETH. ETH specifically used by the Ethereum blockchain to pay for transactions, and is responsible for powering just about everything that occurs on the network. <br /><br /> The Ethereum network can be used by anybody to create and run smart contracts, which are software programs that run autonomously, without user intervention. Ethereum’s growth can be attributed in part to its smart contract capability, which has enabled a growing ecosystem of DApps, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more."

    "description": "BNB is a cryptocurrency that can be used to trade and pay fees on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. BNB is also the cryptocurrency coin that powers the BNB Chain ecosystem. As one of the world's most popular utility tokens, BNB is useful to users in a wide range of applications and use cases. <br /><br /> BNB was launched through an Initial Coin Offering (or ICO) that took place from June 26th to July 3rd, 2017 - 11 days before the Binance Exchange opened for trading. The issue price was 1 ETH for 2,700 BNB or 1 BTC for 20,000 BNB. Although BNB was launched through an ICO, BNB does not provide users with a claim on Binance profits and does not represent an investment in Binance. <br /><br /> With various applications both within the BNB Chain ecosystem and beyond, BNB serves numerous purposes. Originally launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, BNB has now migrated to the main BNB Chain. Although the initial total supply was set at 200 million coins, the supply is gradually decreasing as a result of frequent coin burns. The current price of BNB is updated and available in real-time on Binance."

A small-to-medium breed, it is the smallest of the six original breed of dogs native to Japan.[1] Its name literally translates to 'brushwood dog', as it is used to flush game. <br /><br /> A small, alert, and agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain and hiking trails, the cardano Inu was originally bred for hunting. It looks similar to other Japanese dog breeds such as the Akita Inu or Hokkaido, but the cardano Inu is a different breed with a distinct bloodline, temperament, and smaller size than other Japanese dog breeds."

    "description": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is a novelty cryptocurrency originally launched as a “memecoin” within the cryptocurrency community. Over time, however, Dogecoin has grown into a large blockchain network and is one of the most popular altcoins available in the market. <br /><br /> There is also a serious basis and reason for the creation and development of Dogecoin. Co-founders, Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus, two software engineers by professional background and experience, wanted to make cryptocurrency accessible to individuals outside of Bitcoin. <br /><br /> It was expressed by the founders that the oversaturation and difficulty in mining Bitcoin from the time of its creation to the start of Dogecoin, made it difficult for the common person to participate in the mining process. This was because of limited resources as well as technological experience. Dogecoin was envisioned as an entry for the less experienced to become involved in the crypto industry. <br /><br /> The launch of Bitcoin in 2009 catalyzed the creation and launch of many different cryptocurrencies, each offering different use cases and functionality. Dogecoin, however, offers no specific use cases — DOGE was a collaborative effort by the crypto community and is now listed on most major exchange platforms."

Inspired by Bitcoin, Litecoin was among the earliest altcoins, starting in October 2011. In technical details, the Litecoin main chain shares a slightly modified Bitcoin codebase. <br /><br /> The practical effects of those codebase differences are lower transaction fees, faster transaction confirmations, and faster mining difficulty retargeting. Due to its underlying similarities to Bitcoin, Litecoin has historically been referred to as the 'silver to Bitcoin's gold.'  In 2022, Litecoin added optional privacy features via soft fork through the MWEB (MimbleWimble extension block) upgrade."

On top of this framework, users can implement different application layer protocols, such as Redis, MySQL, Mongo and Postgres. On top of the different protocols, you can abstract some common factors and implement related plug-in capabilities so that different protocols can share these capabilities."
